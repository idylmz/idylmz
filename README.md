# Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm İhsan Deniz. If I have to "title" myself, I can say I am a resilience engineer. 

I graduated from university with a Bachelor's on Computer Engineering in 2021 June. I started working as a software developer long before I graduated. Though I started my career as a fullstack dev, now I am working for the resilience of the applications in production. Since 2018, I am in the IT sector.

## 👨‍💼 What Do I Do Now?

- I build alarms that could indicate any potential threat to application's health.
- I build dashboards to track how application is behaving with the help of network and application performance monitoring tools.
- I analyze dump files and metrics to find root cause of certain problems in any environment including production.
- I analyze application performance and breaking points on under pressure with load tests.
- I periodically report these findings to the regarding teams to improve user experience and prevent the production from hanging or crashing.

## 🛠️ What Is My Skill Set?

- **Backend:** .NET, Node.JS (mostly TS but sometimes JS and no, I am not defining every object as 'any' 😃 ), Some Python
- **Frontend:** Angular, React, Blazor, ASP
- **Database:** SQL Server, MySQL
- **DevOps:** GitLab CI/CD, Azure
- **Monitoring:** DynaTrace, AppResponse, Aeternity
- **Caching:** Redis, MemCache
- **Logging:** ElasticSearch, Kibana, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus
- **Debugging:** Visual Studio, DebugDiag, WinDbg
- **Reverse-Forward Proxy:** IIS, NGinx, Squid
- **Cloud:** VM, VLAN

## 🔭 Current Projects

- [Trace360](https://trace360.finance): A project that people can track their incomes and expenses. Plus, they can see detailed reports to make sure they don't run out of money in the future.
- Voimoji: Voimoji lets people edit the audio part of YouTube videos and share them across their friends. It is kinda like auditional emoji. The project is not live now.
